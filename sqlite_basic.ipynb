    "### Windows Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.\n",
    "2. Type the following command to install SQLite using Chocolatey:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "choco install sqlite\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. To verify the installation, type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sqlite3\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Creating an SQLite Database\n",
    "1. Create a directory where you want to create your SQLite database.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open PowerShell and navigate to that directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a new database with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "C:\\Documents\\yourDB> NewItem yourDB.db\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note: The file extension does not affect SQLite.\n",

    "### Creating a Table\n",
    "\n",
    "In a relational database, tables store data. To create a table, you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the name of the table.\n",
    "2. Define the attributes (columns) in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "create table movies(\n",
    "\ttitle,\n",
    "  released,\n",
    "  overview,\n",
    "  rating,\n",
    "  director\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "* **Note**: This basic SQLite command does not specify data types. Other SQL databases require specific data types for each attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inserting Values\n",
    "1. Insert a single row:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO movies VALUES('The Godfather', 1980, 'The best movie in the world', 10, 'F.F.C');\n",
    "```\n",
    "  * Remember the order of the attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Insert multiple rows:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO movies VALUES\n",
    "('The Godfather', 1980, 'The best movie in the world', 10, 'F.F.C'),\n",
    "('1984', 1983, 'super', 10, 'unknown');\n",
    "```\n",
    "  * Drawbacks: Must remember the order of attributes and provide values for all attributes. Use NULL for unknown values.\n",
    "3. Insert specific attributes (recommended):\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO movies (title) VALUES('The Lord of The Rings');\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO movies (title, rating) VALUES('The Lord of The Rings II', 10);\n",
    "```\n",
    "  * This method allows other attributes to be NULL if not specified\n"

    "* Common Data Types:\n",
    "  * `TEXT` for strings.\n",
    "  * `INTEGER` for whole numbers.\n",
    "  * `REAL` for floating-point numbers.\n",
    "  * `BLOB` for binary data.\n",
    "  * `SQLite does not support BOOLEAN`; use INTEGER with a range restriction instead.\n",
    "  * `STRICt` for forcing the types.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Database-Specific Functions and Data Types\n",
    "* **Important Note:** SQL functions and data types can vary between different database systems. `While the SQL syntax is standardized, specific implementations (like SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) may use different function names or data type specifications.` It's crucial to consult the documentation for the specific SQL database you are using.\n",
    "* For example, SQLite has a unique set of functions, such as LENGTH(X) for string length, and it supports only a limited set of data types compared to other databases."

    "  * UNIQUE: Ensures all values in a column are unique.\n",
    "  * NOT NULL: Ensures a column cannot have NULL values.\n",
    "  * DEFAULT: Sets a default value for a column if none is provided.\n",
    "#### Check Constraint\n",
    "`CHECK` constraints allow custom conditions to restrict data input:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  CREATE TABLE movies(\n",
    "    title TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n",
    "    released INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (released > 0),\n",
    "    overview TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (LENGTH(overview) <= 100),\n",

    "    for_kids INTEGER DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL CHECK (for_kids = 0 OR for_kids = 1)\n",
    "  ) STRICT;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* **Examples:**\n",
    "  * CHECK (released > 0): Ensures released is a positive integer.\n",
    "  * CHECK (LENGTH(overview) <= 100): Limits the length of overview to 100 characters."
