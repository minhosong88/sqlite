    "Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands are used to modify data in a database. DML commands can be categorized into two main types:\n",

    "1. **Update Commands**: Commands that modify data in the database.\n",
    "2. **Query Command**: The `SELECT` command, used to retrieve data from the database.\n"

    "## Update Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Update commands in SQL include `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`. These commands allow you to add, modify, and remove data from tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `INSERT` Command\n",
    "\n",
    "The `INSERT` command adds new rows to a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Insert a new row into the movies table\n",
    "INSERT INTO movies VALUES('The Godfather', 1980, 'The best movie in the world', 10, 'F.F.C');\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 2. `UPDATE` Command\n",
    "\n",
    "The `UPDATE` command modifies existing data in a table. Be cautious when using `UPDATE` without a `WHERE` clause, as it will update all rows in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Update all rows in the movies table to have a rating of 9\n",
    "UPDATE movies SET rating = 9; \n",
    "```\n",
    "To update a single row or specific rows, use a WHERE clause:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Update the rating of a specific movie\n",
    "UPDATE movies SET rating = 9 WHERE title = 'The Godfather';\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. `DELETE` Command\n",
    "The `DELETE` command removes rows from a table. Like `UPDATE`, using `DELETE` without a WHERE clause will remove all rows.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Delete all rows in the movies table\n",
    "DELETE FROM movies;\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Additional Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **`Updating with Calculations:**\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  -- Decrease the rating by 1 for a specific movie\n",
    "  UPDATE movies SET rating = rating - 1 WHERE movie_id = 2;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  * **Handling NULL Values:**\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  -- Update director to 'Unknown' where the director is NULL\n",
    "  UPDATE movies SET director = 'Unknown' WHERE director IS NULL;\n",
    "  ```\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "attachments": {},
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Query Command\n",
    "The `SELECT` command is the most frequently used command in SQL. It allows you to query and retrieve data from tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `SELECT` Command\n",
    "The `SELECT` command returns data from one or more columns:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Perform basic arithmetic and string operations\n",
    "SELECT 1+1, 2+2, UPPER('hello');\n",
    "```\n",
    "seach argument becomes the name of the column and the result will be the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "| 1+1 | 2+2 | UPPER('hello') |\n",
    "| --- | --- | -------------- |\n",
    "| 2   | 4   | HELLO          |\n",
    "\n",
    "### `FROM` Clause\n",
    "The `FROM` clause specifies the source table(s) for the query.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Select all columns from the movies table\n",
    "SELECT * FROM movies;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Select specific columns from the movies table\n",
    "SELECT title, rating FROM movies;\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `FROM` clause is executed first in the SQL command flow, fetching the data from the specified table(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "**`WHERE` Clause**\n",
    "The `WHERE` clause filters rows based on specified conditions:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM movies WHERE director = 'Guy Ritchie';\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Logical Operators\n",
    "  * `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` can be used to combine multiple conditions:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT * FROM movies \n",
    "  WHERE status = 'Planned' AND budget <> 0 AND budget IS NOT NULL;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "#### Range and Membership Conditions\n",
    "* Range Condition:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM movies WHERE rating BETWEEN 7 AND 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Membership Condition:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM movies WHERE genres IN ('Documentary', 'Comedy');\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Pattern Matching with `LIKE`\n",
    "The `LIKE` operator is used for pattern matching in strings:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Find movies with titles starting with 'The'\n",
    "SELECT * FROM movies WHERE title LIKE 'The%';\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Find movies with genres containing 'Drama'\n",
    "SELECT * FROM movies WHERE genres LIKE '%Drama%';\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Wildcard Characters:\n",
    "  * `%` matches any sequence of characters.\n",
    "  * `_` matches a single character.\n",
    "### SELECT `CASE`\n",
    "The `CASE` statement creates conditional logic in a `SELECT` query:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  title,\n",
    "  CASE\n",
    "    WHEN rating >= 8 THEN '‚ù§Ô∏è'\n",
    "    WHEN rating <= 6 THEN 'üí©'\n",
    "    ELSE 'ü§ê'\n",
    "  END AS good_or_bad\n",
    "FROM movies;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `ORDER BY` Clause\n",
    "The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the result set. By default, it sorts in ascending order (`ASC`), but you can specify descending order (`DESC`):\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM movies ORDER BY release_date DESC, revenue DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` Clauses\n",
    "These clauses limit the number of rows returned by a query:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Get the top 5 results\n",
    "SELECT * FROM movies LIMIT 5;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Get the next 5 results after skipping the first 5\n",
    "SELECT * FROM movies LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` Clauses\n",
    "`GROUP BY` is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into aggregated data:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "  director,\n",
    "  SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue\n",
    "FROM movies\n",
    "WHERE director IS NOT NULL AND revenue IS NOT NULL\n",
    "GROUP BY director\n",
    "ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Common Aggregation Functions\n",
    "  * `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`, `COUNT()`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `HAVING` Clause\n",
    "The `HAVING` clause is similar to `WHERE` but is used to filter groups created by the `GROUP BY` clause:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  release_date,\n",
    "  ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) AS avg_rating\n",
    "FROM movies\n",
    "WHERE rating IS NOT NULL AND release_date IS NOT NULL\n",
    "GROUP BY release_date\n",
    "HAVING avg_rating > 6\n",
    "ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Important Notes\n",
    "1. **Execution Order of SQL Commands:**\n",
    "  * The order of execution in SQL is important: `FROM` ‚Üí `WHERE` ‚Üí `GROUP BY` ‚Üí `SELECT` ‚Üí `HAVING` ‚Üí `ORDER` `BY` ‚Üí `LIMIT`.\n",
    "2. **Database-Specific Functions and Features:**\n",
    "  * SQL syntax and functions can vary between different database systems (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL). Always consult the specific documentation for your SQL database.\n"
