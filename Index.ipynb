    "We are looking at leaf nodes. \n",
    "1. **Efficient Disk I/O:** B+ trees are optimized for systems where disk I/O is the bottleneck. They `minimize the number of disk accesses` required to locate data, which is crucial for databases that store large amounts of data on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Minimized Tree Height:** By `allowing multiple keys and children per node`, B+ trees reduce the height of the tree, ensuring that searches, insertions, and deletions can be performed quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Range Queries:** `B+ trees are particularly good for range queries` (e.g., finding all values between two keys). `Because all leaf nodes are linked`, it's easy to traverse from one leaf to the next without needing to go back up the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Balanced Structure:** B+ trees maintain `a balanced structure`, ensuring `consistent performance for all operations. `This balancing is done automatically during insertion and deletion operations, making B+ trees self-balancing."

The leaf nodes of the B+ tree contain pointers to the actual data records in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Retrieval:** Once the leaf node is found, it provides `a direct pointer`` to the location of the actual data record`. This means the data can be retrieved in a similarly efficient manner, without the need to perform a full table scan.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In a **clustered index,** `the actual table data is stored in the leaf nodes of the B+ tree itself.` Therefore, searching for data using a clustered index involves traversing the B+ tree and directly reaching the data stored in its leaf nodes.(primary is index for the table)\n",
