    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "* **Subqueries and CTEs** help to simplify complex queries by breaking them into smaller, reusable parts.\n",
    "* **Independent Subqueries** are cached to avoid repeated execution.\n",
    "* **Correlated Subqueries** can be powerful but need careful consideration due to their performance impact.\n",
    "* **CTEs** improve readability and maintainability, especially for complex queries involving multiple calculations or filters."

    "## 1. List movies with a rating or revenue higher than the average rating or revenue of all movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without subqueries, achieving this would require two queries: one to calculate the average and another to filter the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT avg(rating) FROM movies;\n",
    "SELECT title, count(*) \n",
    "FROM movies\n",
    "WHERE rating > 5.73; -- value copied from the first query\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Subqueries\n",
    "Instead, we can use a subquery. Subqueries are `enclosed in parentheses` within the main query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  count(*)\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "  movies\n",
    "WHERE\n",
    "  rating > (\n",
    "    SELECT\n",
    "      avg(rating)\n",
    "    FROM\n",
    "      movies\n",
    "  );\n",
    "```\n",
    "If a subquery is run for each row, it would slow down the query. However, when the subquery result does not change (i.e., it is independent of the outer query), the database will run the subquery only once and cache the result for filtering purposes. This is known as an **independent subquery**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using CTEs (Common Table Expressions)\n",
    "CTEs allow you to reuse subqueries within a query.\n",
