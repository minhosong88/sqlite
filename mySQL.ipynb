    "## How to modify a table after creation.\n",
    "This section covers the MySQL commands used to modify an existing table, including dropping columns, renaming columns, renaming the table, and modifying constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Drop Columns**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "alter table users drop column profile_picture;\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 2. **Rename Columns**\n",
    "You can rename a column and optionally change its data type using the `ALTER TABLE` command with `CHANGE COLUMN`. If you only want to change the data type of a column, use `MODIFY COLUMN`.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE users CHANGE COLUMN bio about_me TINYTEXT; -- Renames 'bio' to 'about_me' and sets its type to TINYTEXT\n",
    "ALTER TABLE users MODIFY COLUMN about_me TEXT; -- Changes the type of 'about_me' to TEXT\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 3. **Rename Table**\n",
    "To rename a table, use the `ALTER TABLE` command with `RENAME` TO.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE users RENAME TO customers; -- Renames the table 'users' to 'customers'\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 4. **Modify Constraints**\n",
    "To modify constraints (e.g., `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`), you first need to drop the existing constraint and then add a new one with the desired modification.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE users\n",
    "DROP CONSTRAINT username, -- Drops the 'username' unique constraint\n",
    "DROP CONSTRAINT chk_age;  -- Drops the 'chk_age' check constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE users\n",
    "ADD CONSTRAINT username UNIQUE (username), -- Adds a unique constraint on 'username'\n",
    "ADD CONSTRAINT chk_age CHECK (age < 100);  -- Adds a check constraint to ensure 'age' is less than 100\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 5. **Modifying Column Nullability**\n",
    "You can change whether a column allows NULL values or not by using the ALTER TABLE statement with the MODIFY COLUMN clause.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE users MODIFY COLUMN bed_time TIME NULL; -- Allowing NULL values\n",

    "# Handling Data Type Conflicts in SQL Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifying a column's data type in an existing table can be expensive and error-prone, especially when there is a conflict between existing data and the new data type. This section outlines strategies to handle such conflicts effectively using SQL commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Potential Issues with `ALTER TABLE`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expensive Operation**: The `ALTER TABLE` command can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, particularly for large tables, as it often requires rewriting the entire table.\n",
    "- **Data Type Conflicts**: If you attempt to modify a column's data type to one that conflicts with the existing data (e.g., changing `YEAR` to `DATE`), SQL will raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Strategies to Handle Data Type Conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "When modifying a column to a new data type that conflicts with existing data, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scenario**: Changing `graduation_year` (currently `YEAR`) to `graduation_date` (`DATE`)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a New Column**: Instead of directly modifying the column, create a new column with the desired data type.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Update the New Column with Transformed Data**:\n",
    "   - Use SQL functions like `MAKEDATE()` to transform and update data from the old column format to the new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Drop the Old Column**: Once the new column has been populated with the appropriate data, drop the old column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "/*Direct Modification (Causes Error)**\n",
    "Attempting to directly modify the column type results in an error due to conflicting data types:*/\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE users MODIFY COLUMN graduation_year DATE; -- Causes error due to data type conflict\n",
    "\n",
    "/* Safe Modification Approach\n",
    "To safely change graduation_year from YEAR to DATE*/\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN graduation_date DATE; -- Create a new column with the desired type\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE users \n",
    "SET graduation_date = MAKEDATE(graduation_year, 1); -- Populate new column with transformed data\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN graduation_year; -- Remove the obsolete column\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE users MODIFY COLUMN graduation_date DATE NOT NULL; -- Set constraints on the new column\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "/*Alternative Method: Using a Default Value During Creation\n",
    "Instead of updating the new column after creation, you can create it with a default value based on the old column:*/\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE users \n",
    "ADD COLUMN graduation_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT MAKEDATE(graduation_year, 1); -- Create new column with default values\n",
    "\n",

    "## Generated Columns in SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "Generated columns are columns in a table that are automatically computed based on an expression. SQL provides two types of generated columns: **stored** and **virtual**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Stored Generated Columns**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: A stored generated column calculates its value and then stores the result on disk, just like a regular column.\n",
    "- **Advantages**:\n",
    "  - The calculated value is stored on disk, making retrieval faster since the database does not need to recompute the value every time the column is accessed.\n",
    "  - Suitable for frequently accessed columns where the calculation is expensive.\n",
    "- **Usage**:\n",
    "  - Use `STORED` when you expect to read the generated column often and want to optimize for read performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Virtual Generated Columns**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: A virtual generated column calculates its value on the fly when the column is accessed; it is not stored on disk.\n",
    "- **Advantages**:\n",
    "  - Saves disk space since the value is not stored but computed only when needed.\n",
    "  - Ideal for columns that are not accessed frequently or where the calculation is inexpensive.\n",
    "- **Usage**:\n",
    "  - Use `VIRTUAL` for columns where storage efficiency is more critical than read performance.\n",
    "### **Creating a Table with a Stored/virtual Generated Column**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "create table users_v2 (\n",
    "  user_id bigint unsigned primary key auto_increment,\n",
    "  first_name varchar(50),\n",
    "  last_name varchar(50),\n",
    "  email varchar(50),\n",
    "  full_name varchar(101) generated always as(concat(first_name,\" \",last_name)) stored; --stored\n",
    ");\n",

    "\n",
    "select * from users_v2;\n",
    "```\n",
    "* When to Use STORED:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If the calculation is complex or resource-intensive.\n",
    "  * If the column is accessed frequently in queries and performance is a concern.\n",
    "  * When you want to avoid recalculating the value every time it is accessed.\n",
    "* When to Use VIRTUAL:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If the calculation is simple or inexpensive.\n",

    "## Database Normalization and Foreign Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Data Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Data normalization is the process of structuring a relational database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity by following a series of normal forms. In this note, we will address problems in database design and fix them, ultimately achieving **Third Normal Form (3NF)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Data Entity and Foreign Key\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Entities\n",
    "\n",
    "Having multiple unrelated entities in the same table violates the principles of good database design. Below is an example where different entities (dogs and owners) are stored in the same table:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE dogs (\n",
    "    dog_id BIGINT UNSIGNED PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n",
    "    breed_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n",
    "    breed_size_category ENUM('small', 'medium', 'big') DEFAULT 'small',\n",
    "    breed_typical_lifespan TINYINT,\n",
    "    date_of_birth DATE,\n",
    "    weight DECIMAL(5, 2),\n",
    "    owner_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n",
    "    owner_email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,\n",
    "    owner_phone VARCHAR(20),\n",
    "    owner_address TINYTEXT\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Solution: Separate Entities\n",
    "\n",
    "Separate the data entities into different tables. For instance, create separate tables for `dogs`, `breeds`, and `owners`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE dogs (\n",
    "    dog_id BIGINT UNSIGNED PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n",
    "    date_of_birth DATE,\n",
    "    weight DECIMAL(5, 2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE breeds (\n",
    "    breed_id BIGINT UNSIGNED PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n",
    "    size_category ENUM('small', 'medium', 'big') DEFAULT 'small',\n",
    "    typical_lifespan TINYINT\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE owners (\n",
    "    owner_id BIGINT UNSIGNED PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n",
    "    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,\n",
    "    phone VARCHAR(20),\n",
    "    address TINYTEXT\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Step 2: Connecting the Entities with Foreign Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the entities are separated into their respective tables, we need to establish relationships between them using **foreign keys**. We will add `owner_id` and `breed_id` in the `dogs` table to connect it with the `owners` and `breeds` tables, respectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE dogs (\n",
    "    dog_id BIGINT UNSIGNED PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n",
    "    date_of_birth DATE,\n",
    "    weight DECIMAL(5, 2),\n",
    "    owner_id BIGINT UNSIGNED,\n",
    "    breed_id BIGINT UNSIGNED\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "The foreign key columns in the `dogs` table will reference the `owner_id` in the `owners` table and the `breed_id` in the` breeds` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Inserting Data into Each Table\n",
    "\n",
    "With the relationships in place, we can now insert data into the tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO breeds (name, size_category, typical_lifespan)\n",
    "VALUES ('Golden Retriever', 'big', 12);\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO owners (name, email, phone, address)\n",
    "VALUES ('Adam Smith', 'adam@smith.com', '1122334455', '9101 St. Scotland');\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO dogs (name, date_of_birth, weight, owner_id, breed_id)\n",
    "VALUES ('Bob', '2018-03-15', 10.5, 1, 1);\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `1 `is the `owner_id` and `breed_id` corresponding to the data inserted in the `owners` and `breeds` tables.\n",
    "### Step 4: Enforcing Data Integrity with Foreign Key Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign key constraints help ensure data integrity by preventing invalid or inconsistent data. In the case of a delete operation, you can specify what should happen to the associated records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how you can define foreign key constraints with specific actions on delete:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE dogs (\n",
    "    dog_id BIGINT UNSIGNED PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n",
    "    date_of_birth DATE,\n",
    "    weight DECIMAL(5, 2),\n",
    "    owner_id BIGINT UNSIGNED,\n",
    "    breed_id BIGINT UNSIGNED DEFAULT 2,\n",
    "    CONSTRAINT fk_owner FOREIGN KEY (owner_id) REFERENCES owners (owner_id) ON DELETE SET NULL,\n",
    "    CONSTRAINT fk_breed FOREIGN KEY (breed_id) REFERENCES breeds (breed_id) ON DELETE SET DEFAULT\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Possible Actions for `ON DELETE`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CASCADE**: Deletes the related data. For example, if an owner is deleted, the associated dog records are also deleted.\n",
    "- **SET NULL**: Sets the foreign key to `NULL` when the referenced record is deleted.\n",
    "- **SET DEFAULT**: Assigns a default value to the foreign key when the referenced record is deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Handling Foreign Key Deletions\n",
    "\n",
    "If you forgot to set a foreign keys `ON DELETE` condition, you can drop the existing foreign key and re-add it with the necessary conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Drop the Foreign Key**:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE dogs\n",
    "DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_owner;\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. **Add the Foreign Key with the Desired Condition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE dogs\n",
    "ADD CONSTRAINT fk_owner FOREIGN KEY (owner_id)\n",
    "REFERENCES owners (owner_id) ON DELETE SET NULL;\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Step 6: Relationships Between Entities\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One-to-Many Relationship\n",
    "- **One breed** can be associated with **many dogs** (a dog breed can have multiple dogs), which creates a **one-to-many** relationship between `breeds` and `dogs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One-to-One Relationship\n",
    "To establish a **one-to-one** relationship, you can enforce a `UNIQUE` constraint on the foreign key in the child table. For example, a pet passport is uniquely associated with a dog:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE pet_passports (\n",
    "    pet_passport_id BIGINT UNSIGNED PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n",
    "    blood_type VARCHAR(10),\n",
    "    allergies TEXT,\n",
    "    last_checkup_date DATE,\n",
    "    dog_id BIGINT UNSIGNED UNIQUE,\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (dog_id) REFERENCES dogs (dog_id) ON DELETE CASCADE\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE tricks (\n",
    "    trick_id BIGINT UNSIGNED PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n",
    "    difficulty ENUM('easy', 'medium', 'hard') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'easy'\n",
    ");\n",
    "Here, the `dog_id` is unique in the `pet_passports` table, ensuring that each dog can have only one passport.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Many-to-Many Relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent a **many-to-many** relationship, we use a **bridge table**. For example, a dog can learn many tricks, and a trick can be performed by many dogs. We create a `dog_tricks` table with a composite primary key of `dog_id` and `trick_id`:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE dog_tricks (\n",
    "    dog_id BIGINT UNSIGNED,\n",
    "    trick_id BIGINT UNSIGNED,\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (dog_id) REFERENCES dogs (dog_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (trick_id) REFERENCES tricks (trick_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n",
    "    proficiency ENUM('beginner', 'intermediate', 'expert') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'beginner',\n",
    "    date_learned TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n",
    "    PRIMARY KEY (dog_id, trick_id)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dog_tricks` table records the proficiency of each dog for each trick, creating a **many-to-many** relationship between `dogs` and `tricks`.\n",
    "#### Why We Need a Bridge Table\n",
    "\n",
    "A **bridge table** (also known as a junction or associative table) is necessary for handling many-to-many relationships between two entities. Without a bridge table, it would be impossible to store multiple connections between these two entities in a structured way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we tried to store `dog_id` and `trick_id` directly in either the `dogs` or `tricks` table, you would face several problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Redundancy**: Storing multiple `trick_id` values for a single `dog_id` within one table would violate normalization rules, leading to data redundancy.\n",
    "- **Scalability Issues**: A fixed number of columns cannot account for an unknown number of relationships (i.e., dogs learning new tricks or tricks being learned by multiple dogs).\n",
    "- **Data Integrity**: Without a bridge table, relationships may become inconsistent or difficult to manage, leading to potential errors such as:\n",
    "    - Duplicating rows in either the `dogs` or `tricks` table.\n",
    "    - Creating unmanageable data structures when new tricks or dogs are added.\n"

    "## How to Query Data Spread Across Multiple Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using JOIN\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Cross Join (not as useful)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **cross join** matches every single row of the first table with every single row of the second table. This is rarely useful but can be used when all possible combinations of rows are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM dogs CROSS JOIN owners;\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Use case**: When all combinations are needed. Rarely happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Inner Join (most of the time)\n",
    "\n",
    "An **inner join** is the most common type of join. It returns only the rows where there is a match between the two tables. You don't need to explicitly write `INNER`; just using `JOIN` is sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM dogs JOIN owners ON dogs.owner_id = owners.owner_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "When dealing with tables that have the same column names, use `aliases` to avoid confusion:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    dogs.name AS dog_name,\n",
    "    owners.name AS owner_name,\n",
    "    breeds.name AS breed_name\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "    dogs\n",
    "    JOIN owners ON dogs.owner_id = owners.owner_id\n",
    "    JOIN breeds ON dogs.breed_id = breeds.breed_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Shortcut:** If the column names are the same in both tables, you can use the USING clause for a shorter query.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    dogs.name AS dog_name,\n",
    "    owners.name AS owner_name,\n",
    "    breeds.name AS breed_name\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "    dogs\n",
    "    JOIN owners USING (owner_id)\n",
    "    JOIN breeds USING (breed_id);\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, however, rows from the `dogs` table without a matching `owner` or `breed` will be left out of the result.\n",
    "#### 3. Outer Join\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of **outer join**: **left** and **right**. The keyword `OUTER` is optional, but you must specify `LEFT` or `RIGHT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use LEFT or RIGHT**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **left join** returns all rows from the first table (in this case, `dogs`), along with matching rows from the second table (`owners`). If there are no matches, NULL values will be shown for the columns from the second table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    dogs.name AS dog_name,\n",
    "    owners.name AS owner_name\n",

    "    dogs\n",
